== Introduction
**CookBuddy** is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes. More importantly, CookBuddy is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CookBuddy can get your recipe management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Proceed to [Quick Start](#2.-Quick-Start) to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed on your machine.
    - If not, download the latest Java Runtime Environment [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). 

2. Download the latest CookBuddy.jar.
 
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CookBuddy program.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
   
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   
6. Some example commands you can try:
   
   *    list : lists all recipes
   
   *    new recipe n/Chicken Rice ing/<Chicken, 1; ...> ins/<Mix Chicken with Rice>: 
    adds a recipe named Chicken Rice to the CookBuddy program.
    
   *    delete 3 : deletes the 3rd recipe shown in the current list 
    
   *    exit : exits the app
